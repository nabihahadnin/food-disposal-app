# Wanita Data: Data Project Cohort 2 (Food Disposal App)

Hello!

This repository is a compilation of codes that will be used for our project demo.

Thank you.


## Project Description:

#### This project is an 8-week collaborative effort to simplify the method of disposing food waste in a more sustainable way.
#### Rather than throwing them in the bin, why not send them to proper centres or organisations that compost them?
#### The idea is to build a web app that shows you the nearest food disposal centre depending on where you are.
#### We will be focusing on only within Kuala Lumpur for now.
