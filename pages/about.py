            Food waste disposal refers to the process of properly managing and getting rid of leftover or unwanted food. 
            Instead of throwing food waste into the regular trash, which ends up in landfills and produces harmful greenhouse gases, 
            food waste disposal involves methods like composting, recycling, or donating edible food. Proper food waste disposal helps reduce 
            environmental impact and supports sustainable living.
